Setup sanity

 Test far from spawn (spawn-protection off or you’re outside it).

 All players in Survival (not Adventure/Spectator).

 Run /share and confirm:

 Everyone’s inventory (incl. armor + offhand) is cleared

 Everyone’s effects are cleared

 Health/food/air reset as expected

Inventory sharing

 Pick up items from ground (player A picks up) → appears for all

 Pick up items (player B picks up) → appears for all

 Stack counts match perfectly across all players

 Crafting: craft planks/tools → result + ingredient consumption syncs

 Split stacks (right-click) → all players match

 Move items between slots/hotbar → all players match

 Drop items (Q) → removed for all (and only one dropped entity appears)

 Throw entire stack (Ctrl+Q) → removed for all

 Offhand swap (F) → all players match

 Equip/unequip armor → all players match

 Break a tool by using it → tool breaks for all

Block interactions

 Place blocks (A places) → stack decreases for all, block placed once

 Place blocks (B places) → same

 Break blocks (A breaks) → drop appears, pickup sync works

 Break blocks (B breaks) → same

 Use blocks with states:

 Doors/trapdoors/levers/buttons

 Chests (open + move items inside; inventory stays synced)

 Furnace: insert fuel/smelt + take output

 Anvil: rename/repair (XP + item damage sync)

 Crafting table (grid actions don’t desync)

Hunger / saturation / exhaustion

 Sprint until hunger drops → everyone’s hunger drops together

 Jump/sprint a lot → exhaustion/saturation behavior matches for all

 Eat food (A eats) → hunger/saturation changes for all, item consumed for all

 Eat food (B eats) → same

 Use suspicious stew / special foods → effects sync

Health / damage / healing

 Fall damage on A → everyone takes same health reduction

 Fall damage on B → same

 Mob hits A → everyone loses hearts similarly

 Mob hits B → same

 Regeneration (natural) occurs → all heal together

 Use healing item (golden apple / potion) → health/effects sync

 Totem of Undying (if you want this shared) → triggers consistently (note: can be weird if multiple would “die” at once)

Potion/status effects

 Drink potion (speed/strength) → effect appears for all with same duration/amplifier

 Splash potion on one player → applies to all

 Milk bucket clears effects → clears for all

 Negative effects:

 Poison / Wither

 Slowness / Weakness

 Blindness / Darkness

 Fire Resistance + standing in fire/lava → sync looks consistent

Air / drowning

 A stays underwater until air drops → everyone’s air drops

 A starts drowning → everyone takes drowning damage

 B surfaces → air returns for all

Fire / freeze

 A catches fire → everyone burns (fire ticks sync)

 A extinguishes (water) → everyone stops burning

 Freeze in powdered snow → freeze ticks sync (everyone freezes together)

XP sharing

 Collect XP orbs (A picks) → levels/exp bar match for all

 Spend XP (anvil/enchant) → decreases for all

Join/leave behavior

 Player joins while sharing is active:

 They get cleared (as designed)

 Within a tick, they match the shared state

 Player leaves while sharing:

 Remaining players continue normally

 Run /unshare:

 Everyone gets cleared again (as designed)

 After /unshare, states are no longer linked

“Smoothness / no bugs” checks

 No item duplication

 No “ghost items” (items snap back / disappear)

 No “ghost blocks” (block appears then reverts)

 No console spam / errors

 No noticeable lag spikes with 2–5 players
